## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/), fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Danyang Zhuo](https://danyangzhuo.com/). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) where I had the valuable opportunity to work with Prof. [Zhiqiang Zuo](https://z-zhiqiang.github.io/) and Prof. [Qingkai Shi](https://qingkaishi.github.io/).

## Research Interests

My research goal is to build high-performance systems with strong correctness and security guarantees. I believe the most effective solutions are practical ones, built on solid foundations that span the entire system stack.

To this end, I have explored various approaches, including using language-based safety to build a robust embedded OS ([Hopter](assets/files/mobisys25.pdf)) and leveraging hardware-assisted tracing to create an efficient data race detector ([HardRace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18412)).
